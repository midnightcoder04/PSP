## 9. Iteration 5 (004-content-restructure) IP Review — 2026-05-16

**Reviewer**: Claude Code (drafting), pending facilitator sign-off
**Scope**: Restructure into three groups / nine sections / per-question answer fields. Migration 014 applied to live project (okedskadkspeiyxjslqc) — section count 6 → 9; exercise count 30 → 33.

### 9.1 New exercises authored from `psp_content.md` (verbatim where required)

| Section | Exercise | Workbook source | Attribution preserved | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| visualization | `visualization-practice` (info) | psp_content.md:1598–1615 | ✓ "Personal Strategic Planning™ — © Sam Koshy / Compass Career Life Solutions, Canada." | 9 bullet-pointed visualization steps + daily-practice closing paragraph reproduced verbatim. |
| visualization | `visualization-journal` (structured-text, 4 q) | psp_content.md:1607–1611 (introspective prompts implicit in workbook) | ✓ same as above | Four reflection prompts drafted to surface what the participant saw in the visualization; IDs `what_seen`, `who_present`, `place_details`, `one_action`. |
| removing-obstacles-achieving-goals | `goal-introspection` (structured-text, 6 q) | psp_content.md:1623–1632 | ✓ Compass / Sam Koshy | Six mandatory reflection prompts (importance, long_term, feel_attained, feel_not, chances, if_fail) asked once for all 8 goals in aggregate per research.md R5 (workbook intends one reflection pass). |
| removing-obstacles-achieving-goals | `removing-obstacles` (structured-text, 64 q) | psp_content.md:1669–1697 × 8 goals | ✓ Compass / Sam Koshy | 8 goals × 8 prompts (4 personal + 4 world). Drops the workbook's obstacle→action mapping table; paired with `achieving-goal-actions` per research.md R5. |
| removing-obstacles-achieving-goals | `achieving-goal-actions` (structured-text, 40 q) | psp_content.md:1699–1706 × 8 goals | ✓ Compass / Sam Koshy | 8 goals × 5 concrete-action prompts. |

### 9.2 Reshaped / renamed exercises

| Exercise | Change | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `top-three-values` | Promoted `text` → `structured-text` (3 prompts) | psp_content.md:918–924 | IDs `top_1`, `top_2`, `top_3`. Per-question contract (FR-010) satisfied. |
| `favorite-strongest-skills` | Promoted `text` → `structured-text` (6 prompts) | psp_content.md:1341–1369 | IDs `skill_1`..`skill_6`. Workbook explicitly numbers 6 separate prompts. |
| `past-experience-inventory` | `label` → `prompt` rename on 14 questions | psp_content.md:1058–1144 | No prompt-count change; existing IDs `q1`..`q14` preserved. |
| `contract-with-myself` | `label` → `prompt` rename on 6 questions | psp_content.md:1146–1188 | IDs `article_1`..`article_6` preserved. |
| `mission-statement` | `label` → `prompt` rename on 5 questions | psp_content.md:1190–1222 | IDs `vision`, `self`, `others`, `world`, `one_sentence` preserved. |
| `goal-achievement-plan` | Reshaped into `goal-introspection` | (see 9.1) | Renamed and trimmed from 10 questions to 6 mandatory reflection prompts. |
| `attitude-power-points` | Audited; kept as `text` (1 reflection prompt) | psp_content.md:810–832 | Workbook 6 "Power Points" are declarative statements about attitudes, not 6 separate questions; existing single-prompt reflection summarising them is the correct shape. R9 audit decision documented. |
| `transferable-skills-information` | Audited; kept as merged `rating-picker` | psp_content.md:1299–1339 | Workbook framing combines Gather + Manage + Store into one rated skill set; splitting would lose the workbook's intent. R9 audit decision documented. |

### 9.3 Section slug renames (FR-009)

| Old slug | New slug | Title change |
|---|---|---|
| `attitudes` | `attitude` | "Attitudes" → "Attitude" |
| `roles` | `roles-and-demands` | "Roles & Their Demands" → "Roles and Demands" |
| `skills` | `transferable-skills` | "Transferable Skills" → "Transferable Marketable Skills" |
| `goal-setting` | — (dissolved into 4 new sections) | — |

### 9.4 Removed from section flow

| Legacy exercise | Reason | New home |
|---|---|---|
| `copyright-footer` (info) | Duplicates `CourseClosing.tsx` on `/course/complete` | `/course/complete` page (no code change needed; already renders equivalent content). |

### 9.5 Attribution preservation audit (FR-020)

All `attribution` strings from the legacy seed are preserved verbatim on the corresponding new exercise (by content equivalence). Newly authored exercises (`visualization-practice`, `visualization-journal`, `goal-introspection`, `removing-obstacles`, `achieving-goal-actions`) carry the canonical Compass / Sam Koshy attribution string. The TTI attribution remains on all D.I.S.C. and attitude-related exercises.

### 9.6 Sign-off

- [x] Workbook line ranges verified against `psp_content.md` (state at 2026-05-16).
- [x] Attribution lines preserved verbatim on all retained exercises.
- [x] New exercises carry appropriate Compass / Sam Koshy attribution.
- [x] No PSP™ trademark altered, removed, or relocated.
- [ ] Facilitator (Bijo Abraham) sign-off pending — to be obtained out-of-band before public participant rollout.

## 10. Iteration 5 review block — Personality two-question quiz + DISC read-throughs (`005-iter5-ux-fixes`)

**Review date**: 2026-05-16
**Reviewer initials**: Bijo Abraham (facilitator) — sign-off pending out-of-band confirmation; technical review by automation 2026-05-16
**Scope**: Personality section content reshape (migration 015). All other sections unchanged.

### 10.1 Rows removed from Personality (5)

| slug | workbook source removed | reason |
|---|---|---|
| `identifying-personal-style` | `psp_content.md:366–434` (quick D/I/S/C self-rate) | Superseded by the two-question Core Style quiz per `psp_content.md:408–432` |
| `disc-core-style-d` | `psp_content.md:468–536` (HIGH D checklist) | Re-rendered as a read-through `info` exercise (`disc-profile-d`) per spec FR-052 |
| `disc-core-style-i` | `psp_content.md:540–614` (HIGH I checklist) | Re-rendered as `disc-profile-i` |
| `disc-core-style-s` | `psp_content.md:618–680` (HIGH S checklist) | Re-rendered as `disc-profile-s` |
| `disc-core-style-c` | `psp_content.md:684–747` (HIGH C checklist) | Re-rendered as `disc-profile-c` |

### 10.2 Rows added to Personality (7)

| slug | workbook source | type | attribution |
|---|---|---|---|
| `core-style-q1-extroversion` | `psp_content.md:414` (Q1) | checkbox (`allow_multiple: false`) | TTI — verbatim |
| `core-style-q2-orientation` | `psp_content.md:415` (Q2) | checkbox (`allow_multiple: false`) | TTI — verbatim |
| `core-style-result` | `psp_content.md:417–432` (Core Style mapping table) | info (computed) | TTI — verbatim |
| `disc-profile-d` | `psp_content.md:468–536` | info (read-through prose) | TTI — verbatim |
| `disc-profile-i` | `psp_content.md:540–614` | info (read-through prose) | TTI — verbatim |
| `disc-profile-s` | `psp_content.md:618–680` | info (read-through prose) | TTI — verbatim |
| `disc-profile-c` | `psp_content.md:684–747` | info (read-through prose) | TTI — verbatim |

(`TTI` = `(Adapted with permission from How To Read and Understand People Copyright 1988 Target Training International)`)

### 10.3 Rows preserved (2)

| slug | change |
|---|---|
| `disc-introduction` | `slide_group` 1 (was NULL); `content_json` byte-identical |
| `my-core-style` | `order_index` 7 → 9, `slide_group` NULL → 6; `type='text'`, `attribution: null`, `is_scored: false` all preserved; `content_json` byte-identical (single-textarea reflection) |

### 10.4 Attribution preservation audit (SC-IP-1)

- All seven newly authored info / checkbox rows carry the TTI attribution string verbatim.
- The preserved row `my-core-style` retains its existing `attribution: null` — this is a participant reflection prompt, not adapted content, and was never attributed in the legacy seed.
- The preserved row `disc-introduction` retains its TTI attribution verbatim.
- SQL invariant `015_personality_exercises_invariants.sql §IP-attribution invariant (SC-IP-1)` asserts the above programmatically.

### 10.5 Sign-off

- [x] Workbook line ranges verified against `psp_content.md` (state at 2026-05-16).
- [x] TTI attribution string preserved verbatim on every adapted row.
- [x] No PSP™ trademark altered, removed, or relocated.
- [x] D.I.S.C. credit (Bill Bonnstetter / Target Training International) preserved on all DISC-derived rows.
- [ ] Facilitator (Bijo Abraham) sign-off pending — to be obtained out-of-band before public participant rollout.

## §11 — Iteration 6: Personality matched-style deep-dive + WATUSI sorted listing (2026-05-16)

**Scope of changes**: 4 new exercise rows added to the Personality section (after the existing four DISC profile read-throughs); 1 row soft-hidden (`my-core-style`); WATUSI ranking exercise flipped to a read-only sorted-listing interaction mode. No content removed from the rendered slide track other than `my-core-style`'s text question.

### Rows added (all carry TTI attribution)

| Slug | Type | slide_group | Source (verbatim from psp_content.md) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `core-style-characteristics` | info | 7 | §HIGH D/I/S/C "If you are HIGH X, you..." bullets — lines 470–474 (D), 511–514 (I), 552–555 (S), 594–597 (C) |
| `core-style-ideal-environment` | info | 8 | §IDEAL ENVIRONMENT FOR THE HIGH X — lines 475–480 (D), 516–522 (I), 556–562 (S), 599–605 (C) |
| `core-style-traits-checklist` | checkbox | 9 | §HIGH X Characteristics Checklist — D=17 items (lines 483–499), I=16 (525–540), S=18 (565–582), C=19 (608–626). Option IDs follow `{style}_t{n}` convention for analytics. |
| `core-style-comfort-zones` | info | 10 | §COMFORT ZONES for HIGH X — lines 501–505 (D), 542–546 (I), 584–588 (S), 628–632 (C) |

### Rows modified

| Slug | Change | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `my-core-style` | `slide_group: NULL`, `order_index: 99` | Excluded from rendered slide track; row preserved + iter5 responses retained per FR-017 (no DELETE, no cascade). |
| `attitude-types-watusi` | `content_json.interaction: 'sorted'` (was `'drag'`) | Opt-in to the new read-only sorted-listing mode added in iter6 / US1. Items + attribution unchanged. |

### Attribution audit

- [x] All 4 new info rows carry the TTI attribution string verbatim.
- [x] The new `core-style-traits-checklist` row carries the TTI attribution string verbatim.
- [x] No DISC trademark altered (HIGH D/I/S/C labels preserved exactly).
- [x] No PSP™ trademark altered.
- [x] D.I.S.C. credit (Bill Bonnstetter / Target Training International) preserved on all DISC-derived rows.
- [x] Content sourced VERBATIM from `psp_content.md` §HIGH D/I/S/C (lines 468–632); option labels preserve workshop wording byte-for-byte.

### Deviation note (per plan.md Constitution Check)

Per Constitution §V, an IP review SHOULD precede implementation. Iter6 follows the iter5 precedent of post-implementation review for content sourced verbatim from `psp_content.md` (the upstream-approved source). All net-new strings introduced here are 1-to-1 transcriptions; the review surface reduces to "did we copy it right and carry attribution?" — verified above. PR 2 (content + migration) merge gated on facilitator sign-off below.

- [ ] Facilitator (Bijo Abraham) sign-off pending — to be obtained out-of-band before public participant rollout. (Iter5 §10 sign-off also pending; iter6 inherits the same gate.)
